  "description": "Scarlet Briar sought to harness the natural flow of magic for selfish purposes, or so people thought. She orchestrated her reign of terror from the shadows, sending her minions across Tyria to dispose of anyone who stood in her way. But by the time her plans were deciphered, terrible events were already in motion that would change Tyria forever.\n\n\n\u003cc\u003d@Quest\u003eUpdate from ArenaNet\u003c/c\u003e\nSelect missions from Living World Season 1 can now be replayed from the Scrying Pool in the Eye of the North. To unlock the quest to relive these missions, complete the story chapter \"Visions of the Past: Steel and Fire.\"\n\n\u003cc\u003d@Warning\u003eMessage from ArenaNet\u003c/c\u003e\nLiving World Season 1 was a series of live content events that ran from January 2013 to March 2014. The story was designed to be experienced as it happened. It is currently unavailable for episodic replay like Season 2, so we\u0027ve created a recap to inform you of the events that bridge the gap between the end of the Personal Story (circa 1325 AE) and Living World Season 2 (1327 AE).\n\nOnce you\u0027ve completed the Season 1 recap, we encourage you to peruse the Season 2 catalog of playable episodes. Season 2 episodes are replayable, so once you\u0027ve unlocked them on your account, you may play them as often as you like, whenever you want. You may enjoy the episodes for free by partying with another player who has them unlocked, or you may purchase them with gems so that you have full access to the associated achievements and rewards.",
