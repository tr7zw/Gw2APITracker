      "complete": "I received a priority message from Logan Thackeray about a developing situation in Lornar\u0027s Pass. Scarlet\u0027s latest handiwork, a massive watchknight mechanical puppet chained to some kind of hovering fortress, was wreaking havoc as part of a deadly weapon test. I met some familiar faces there: Braham, Rox, Marjory, and Kasmeer were fighting against this abomination when an unsupervised and spunky progeny named Taimi charged into battle before I could stop her. So I gave chase. Our group split up and teleported to the individual platforms to disable each power regulator, all while fighting off clockwork monsters and ducking attacks from the colossal marionette. To my surprise, Taimi and her golem proved themselves a capable duo. Eventually, we forced Scarlet to pull her broken toy back for repairs.\n\nAfterward, Taimi mentioned something about Scarlet using an array of devices to probe Tyria, but we couldn\u0027t figure out for what purpose. The others headed to Lion\u0027s Arch to recoup for the marionette\u0027s inevitable return. We were met by Captain Thackeray, who showed up to take the progeny off our hands. Taimi showed some real courage, but her obsession with Scarlet was concerning."
