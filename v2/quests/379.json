We caught up with her in the upper cliffs, where we found her surrounded by Inquest who were trying to steal her invention. They had incapacitated Scruffy and cornered her at the edge of a cliff. Braham and I gave them a sound beating before Phlunt and his associates arrived. Taimi ultimately handed over the W.R.D., since Phlunt\u0027s attendance at the summit hinged on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaimi got a good scare today. Seeing her exposed and without the aid of her golem reminded me that, while she\u0027s a strong and brilliant kid, she still needs support and guidance from usâ€”especially Braham."
