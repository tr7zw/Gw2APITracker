It was a faceless lead, but the only one I had. I made my way to Lion\u0027s Arch to see for myself. The ceremony started without a hitch, but then the effigies were lit...\n\nAs the cultural representatives approached with their offerings, one of the dragon effigies erupted with arcane energies, emitting an electrical current that struck the captains on stage. Inspector Ellen Kiel immediately took control of the scene. With the help of her Lionguard, Kiel and I escorted the wounded to Fort Marriner. Along the way, we were harassed by a group of scrapyard pirates.\n\nWe delivered the captains to the medical ward, but their wounds were critical. Kiel implored me to return to the festivities, but I\u0027m not in the mood for a celebration anymore. Between this and the Molten Alliance... Something is brewing, and I\u0027m fast growing tired of these constant surprises."
