She didn\u0027t believe Knut Whitebear would leave Hoelbrak so long as the Svanir were terrorizing the Shiverpeaks. We vowed to win Whitebear\u0027s good will by disrupting the Svanir presence in Frostgorge Sound."

Eir and Braham will know if what I\u0027ve done is enough to turn Knut Whitebear\u0027s attention from Jormag\u0027s followers to the threat posed by Mordremoth."

Eir was confident that Knut Whitebear would agree to attend the summit at the Grove with the Sons of Svanir shamans now beaten back. I could tell that things were still awkward between the two of them, but that fighting alongside one another gave them some common ground to stand on."
