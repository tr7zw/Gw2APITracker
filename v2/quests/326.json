Pact pilot Arda Gyreshriek, who delivered me to the site, made sure I had assistance against the Risen ground forces while Laranthir of the Wild led a support team after I cleared the zone. With their help, I was able to clear out the cauldron\u0027s Risen defenders and claim this powerful weapon for the Pact."
