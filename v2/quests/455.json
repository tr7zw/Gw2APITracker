Queen Jennah appointed Demmi Beetlestone, a Whispers agent and Caudecus\u0027s own daughter, to guide the team inside. Anise was skeptical, but she bowed to the queen\u0027s wishes. As we left the throne room, Logan declined to join Dragon\u0027s Watchâ€”not to stay by Jennah\u0027s side, but instead to accept General Soulkeeper\u0027s offer to make him the new Pact Marshall."
