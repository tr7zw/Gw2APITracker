Inside, Joko\u0027s Awakened were locked in battle with the Inquest forces. We tracked down the gate hub, defeated a massive force of Awakened, and disabled the gates, finally putting a stop to Joko\u0027s invasion of Tyria.\n\nWe reached the lab where Gorrik and Blish had holed up, and we were shocked to learn that Blish\u0027s consciousness had been transferred into a golem body. Before we could fully process this, the containment-vault alarm began to blare, and Gorrik revealed some disturbing newsâ€”the Inquest had recovered samples of the ancient and deadly Scarab Plague in Fahranur, and now Joko was trying to seize it.\n\nWe raced to the containment vault, but we were too late. Joko damaged the remaining asura gate and set Mordant Crescent Commander Lonai on us while he fled with the plague. The damaged gate sucked us in, and Braham and I braced ourselves for the battle to come."
