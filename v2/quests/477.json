As such, Kesho may well contain the knowledge we need to make a stand against Balthazar. \nIt was swallowed by the desert sands long ago, so Kesho is considered a lost city by the locals, little more than a legend; but I was able to nail down its location in the Elon Riverlands. I\u0027ll need to ride a skimmer mount to reach Kesho safely, but at least now I have a concrete destination to explore."

      "complete": "I entered the lost city of Kesho, and with Taimi\u0027s remote input, I learned all I could. We encountered a traumatized Exalted named Sadizi, as well as a host of dangerous Forged-Exalted hybrids. Sadizi told us these hybrids were created by Balthazar and Palawa Joko, the desert region\u0027s missing tyrant king. Together, the two villains stole the Forgotten ritual that makes Exalted and used it as a means of forcing spirits into armored bodies to create Balthazar\u0027s Forged. \nWe also learned more about the true purpose of Glint\u0027s legacy: to preserve Tyria\u0027s magical balance by replacing Elder Dragons with equally powerful but less predatory entities. And we discovered why Balthazar was hunting Vlast: Kralkatorrik\u0027s blood, both literal and metaphorical, is its unique weakness, meaning Vlast, Glint, and the dragonsblood spear were all viable weapons against Kralkatorrik...and so is Aurene. It\u0027s only a matter of time before Balthazar returns to Tarir to capture her, so I sent word to my guildmates and told them to meet up with me so we can return to Maguuma and protect the Crystal Dragon\u0027s last scion."
