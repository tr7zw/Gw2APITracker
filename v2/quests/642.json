While I was searching for our suspects, she was recalibrating the Tassi box with some of the chemicals found at the crime scene. Our culprit? Mai Trin, the \"ever-helpful\" medic. It turns out that false positive was right all along. She\u0027s apparently the leader of those ragtag pirates that attacked us after the effigy ceremony. They call themselves the \"Aetherblades.\" I\u0027d call them a bunch of brutes, though they must be competent enough if they\u0027ve managed to remain this elusive. Unfortunately, Mai Trin fled the scene before Kiel could make an arrest. Our next goal is to track her down and determine what the \u0027Blades are up to."
