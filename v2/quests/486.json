While I didn\u0027t learn much about Balthazar\u0027s plans, I did destroy several batteries of Forged artillery and thinned out the Forged ranks. At least now Amnoon will get a break from Forged attacks, and at least I deprived the main Forged camp of any reinforcements...which they\u0027re going to need, because I\u0027m headed there next to rendezvous with Canach and Rytlock."

      "complete": "Canach, Rytlock, and I invaded the main Forged camp near Amnoon. Balthazar was not there, so we did as much damage as we could, taking out multiple Forged officers and a massive, heavily armored living weapon. Even if we can\u0027t find Balthazar himself, we\u0027ll keep tearing apart his armies and disrupting his chain of command until he comes to us."

Our conversation was cut short when Balthazar\u0027s herald ambushed the temple and began targeting worshipers and clergy.\nWe eventually drove her away, but the damage had been done: the temple was engulfed in flames, and there were many wounded. We revived as many as we could.\nKito said we shared a common goal in defeating Balthazar. He offered to help us track our target, and we agreed to meet at Makali Outpost."
