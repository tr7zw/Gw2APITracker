      "complete": "Balthazar killed me. He struck while I was en route to rejoining my team, overpowered me, and kept me on the brink of death until Aurene responded. When she felt the danger I was in through our shared bond, she came to protect me...and was promptly captured by the rogue god. Having achieved his goals, Balthazar had no more use for me, and he ended my life.\nI woke in the Domain of the Lost, a kind of way station for lost spirits who have not yet found their way to the Underworld or their final reward. With no memory of who I was, I fought to reclaim my name and purpose, ultimately earning the chance to return to the world of the living. Along the way, I encountered Palawa Joko himself, who had been betrayed and imprisoned in the Domain of the Lost by Balthazar as soon as Joko had served his purpose. King Joko tried to bargain and threaten for his freedom, but I left him where he wasâ€”though I did take him up on his suggestion of using his Awakened army against Balthazar. Once I had returned to life and rejoined my understandably shocked team, we set out to secure the support of Joko\u0027s mummified hordes.\nBecause Balthazar now has Aurene. He intends to use her to kill Kralkatorrik. And I returned from the abyss to prevent that."
