There was little time to catch up, however, as the Amnoon Council invited me to help the city celebrate the defeat of Balthazar and the restoration of peace in the desert region.\nIt was an uncomfortable situation, as Balthazar\u0027s death empowered both Kralkatorrik and Aurene, and no one can say what either of the newly invigorated dragons will do next. Amnoon and the entire desert region are still very much at risk, so when Councilor Imann asked me to give a speech commemorating the occasion, I had to make some hard choices about what I would and would not say.\nAfter my speech, I spoke with Rytlock, Canach, and Kasmeer about our plans. All we know for sure is that we have to find Aurene, and Kralkatorrik, and use what we\u0027ve learned about Elder Dragons and Glint\u0027s legacy to restore the world\u0027s magic before what is now a crisis becomes a full-blown catastrophe.\nThough it may already be too late: as we talked, the skies darkened and the ground shook, and Kralkatorrik itself appeared on the horizon, Branding all in its path as it moved across the desert."
