      "complete": "As I headed back to speak with the others about our plan for Kralkatorrik, a messenger from Glint\u0027s ghost army appeared from the Mists with dire news: Glint\u0027s army had been overrun, and Kralkatorrik had entered the Domain of the Lost, where he was scattering and devouring the dead.\n\nBefore we could come up with a plan to deal with this urgent situation, a Mist rift opened. Aurene channeled her power through the forge\u0027s resonance crystal to defeat Kralkatorrik\u0027s minions, then shocked everyone by Branding over the residual Brandstorm. As the others argued about this troubling new power, Aurene grew frustrated by her inability to speak and defend herself. Caithe finally offered herself to Aurene as a vessel to speak through and stepped into Aurene\u0027s Brand. The result was astounding: teal crystalline flowers blossomed over her as a deep mental and emotional bond joined themâ€”an experience far different from the violent subjugation of Kralkatorrik\u0027s Branding. Speaking through Caithe, Aurene uttered her first words: \"I am not him.\"\n\nAurene\u0027s gesture reassured the others, and together we came up with an improvised plan to lure Kralkatorrik into the forge and use the resonance crystals to help destroy him. To make the plan work, however, we would need to seek out and harness dredge technology to boost the resonance crystals."
