When I said as much to Aurene, she flew around the area and shared her sight with me, revealing a protective shield around the cube, a growing number of Joko\u0027s Awakened in the area, and a communications tower used to coordinate the Inquest\u0027s ground-based facilities and forces.\n\nBraham and Rox stayed with the Olmakhan to help defend them in case of another attack. I infiltrated the Inquest communications facility and sabotaged the tower. Inside, I also discovered an uncorrupted version of Gorrik\u0027s distress message confirming that he and Blish were trapped by Joko\u0027s forces in Rata Primus. I promised Taimi I would do what I could to help them."
