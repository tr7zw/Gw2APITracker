      "complete": "Though Varya had been cooperative with our efforts to this point, she balked at the idea of sending her people into the forge to face down Kralkatorrik. She did, however, explain that the tanks they had lost to the Branded were equipped with the sonic amplifying technology we were looking for. I tracked down the tanks and retrieved three equipment samples for Taimi to reverse engineer."

      "active": "Help Sayida retrieve Canach\u0027s detonators.",
      "complete": "Sayida contacted me to report that a Brandstorm had brought down the airship carrying Canach\u0027s detonators. Canach had formulated an audacious plan to blow up a mountain to drop the rubble onto Kralkatorrik when he arrived. Suddenly, it looked like that plan was in jeopardy. I was able to fight through the Branded that had overrun the wreckage and retrieve the detonators. With Canach\u0027s plan viable again, Sayida agreed to fly his team into position and then lead the rest of the fleet in a barrage of cannon fire against Kralkatorrik when he arrived."

      "complete": "When I returned to the forge, Hilina told me that Taimi and Gorrik had already finished analyzing the dredge parts. She would make the necessary modifications to the resonance crystals in the amphitheater. With everything in place, it was time to put our bold plan into action."
