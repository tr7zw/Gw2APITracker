Logan expressed his thanks for our work in capturing Mai Trin.\n\nOn my way out, I heard Kiel and Magnus discussing her future in Lion\u0027s Arch. He wants her to run for Ashford\u0027s spot on the Captain\u0027s Council, even commandeered one of the abandoned Aetherblade ships for her. If Kiel\u0027s work on the investigation was any indicator of her possible success, I think she\u0027s set up for a good run.\n\nFirst it was the Molten Alliance, now the Aetherblades... We don\u0027t know what\u0027s behind this mess, or who, but every time we think things have calmed down...something else wakes up. Mai Trin mentioned someone named \"Scarlet\" back at the hideout. Maybe that\u0027s our best lead."
