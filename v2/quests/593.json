This seemed a bit odd as the Olmakhan voluntarily had secluded their society for generations. Why would they want to get themselves involved in the conflict now?\n\nTurns out that with the Flame Legion having a change of leadership—and heart—they were open to exploring the idea of a united charr. Rox would be sent as their emissary to hear Crecia\u0027s plan. I agreed to meet them at Bloodtide Coast to help as a neutral mediator."

      "complete": "Upon arriving at the scene, it was clear that the negotiations would be put on hold. The icebrood were ravaging the coast in their quest for domination. We evacuated whoever we could and fended them off before heading to the lighthouse.\n\nCrecia apologized for the unexpected turn of events. Rox took it in stride, reminding everyone that my presence usually resulted in plans going to hell, so this was actually to be expected. (Thanks, Rox.) It felt like old times, though, and my old friend agreed to rejoin the fight. The cause was greater than any single faction\u0027s needs, so we could count on her Olmakhan siblings now and into the future.\n\nWe shored up the lighthouse\u0027s defenses and fended off waves of icebrood until a nasty one appeared on the frozen bay. We tried to attack it, but it surrounded itself with nearly impenetrable walls of thick ice. We utilized cannon fire to shatter them, and then we turned our sights on the creature itself and its reinforcements.\n\nAfter our hard-earned victory, Crecia, Malice, Rox, and I spoke briefly before parting ways, as our enemies were still at large."
