Smodur wasn\u0027t going anywhere so long as the Ascalonian ghosts were haunting the area. Rytlock had discovered a ritual that might send the ghosts back to the Mists, but it required his sword, Sohothin, a mass of souls to fuel it with magic, and the pieces of Adelbern\u0027s crown. I agreed to obtain the crown fragments, which were scattered across the countryside."

Knowing that a full cleansing of the Foefire was impossible without his enchanted blade, he leapt in after it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmodur agreed to attend the summit since the ghost problem, while not solved, was lessened by our efforts. He seemed confident that Rytlock would hold his own while trapped in the Mists, though Rox expressed worry."
