We saw some truly amazing things, including a whole passel of destroyers that Gadd had kept contained for who knows how long. We wiped them out and recovered Gadd\u0027s personal archive, with all his thoughts, notes, and ideas. In short, it\u0027s the find of the century, and thanks to the VOED, it\u0027s all mine."
