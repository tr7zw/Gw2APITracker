And here I thought a war council of battle-hungry Tribunes was intimidating.\n\nThe Molten Alliance has been striking small villages throughout the Shiverpeaksâ€”including Cragstead, Braham\u0027s home. Even though a raid was imminent, Knut was reluctant to send any reinforcements. They\u0027ve got enough of a refugee crisis on their doorstep, same as the charr in the Citadel. Given the way things escalated at the hatchery, I volunteered to join Braham in fighting back."

We don\u0027t know where they were taken yet, but finding their base is next on our list, and the Vigil is hot on their trail.\n\nI didn\u0027t know Eir had a kid, let alone one as...hardheaded as Braham. His head may be full of steam, but he\u0027s got guts if he\u0027s willing to stand up to the Master of the Lodge. Reinforcements or not, he ran right into Cragstead, shield raised."
