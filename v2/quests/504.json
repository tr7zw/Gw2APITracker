She clapped me in irons and escorted me inside.\n\nSayida handed me over to Warden Amala, and with scores of Awakened looking on, she sweet-talked the warden into a toast to Joko, slyly handing over the spiked grog. All was going smoothly until Taimi called me over my communicator, raising the warden\u0027s suspicions. Amala cracked me over the head, and everything went black."

After the jailer outside toppled over from the spiked grog, Zaeim and I escaped and reached the stairwell leading out of the dungeons.\n\nI must still make it past Warden Amala, and time is of the essence: Joko is back from the Domain of the Lost. And he has Taimi."

Even under his control, she was still able to channel the power of the gods, but with the help of Sayida and her corsairs, Zaeim and I brought her down at last."

Zaeim has offered to guide us into Fahranur and has directed us to meet him at a cave on Issnur Bay. There\u0027s no time to waste."
