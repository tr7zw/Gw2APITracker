Still, she\u0027d made two important discoveries. \n\nFirst: One of the destroyed gates at Fahranur led to a big Inquest base, which was likely the location of Joko\u0027s new gate hub. Unfortunately, there was no way to know where that base was located. \n\nSecond: An old friend of Taimi\u0027s, a scientist named Blish, was working at the base. \n\nOur path forward seemed clear: find the scientist, and we\u0027d find Joko\u0027s gate hub."

Braham, Rox, and I disguised ourselves as a live specimen delivery convoy to get inside, and I managed to access the facility\u0027s resource database. Taimi\u0027s scientist was assigned to the Inquest\u0027s Elonian HQ, Rata Primus. \n\nWe attempted to travel to Rata Primus through the facility\u0027s asura gate, but a malfunction on the other end forced us to travel to the nearest alternative lab."
