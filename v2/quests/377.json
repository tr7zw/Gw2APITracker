As a result, they are now uninteresting to Mordremoth\u0027s minions. This impressed Councillor Phlunt and his Arcane Council associates so much that they wanted the device for themselves. Taimi didn\u0027t like the idea of giving up the new invention she worked so hard to develop, so she ran off with it. Braham and I need to find her and convince her to relinquish the W.R.D. for the greater cause."
