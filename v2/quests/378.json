      "complete": "I received a mail from Kasmeer, who informed me that Queen Jennah\u0027s attendance at the summit is in jeopardy. Minister Estelle claimed that the queen had secretly met with Scarlet and essentially gave her access to the watchknights. Had I not found multiple witnesses who would back up Countess Anise\u0027s accounts of the queen\u0027s activities that day (and Minister Estelle\u0027s little gambling outing), Queen Jennah would have been unable to attend the summit. With her lies exposed, Estelle will recant her storyâ€”and possibly cooperate with Countess Anise in future matters. She really has no choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the party, Kasmeer was given the honor of escorting Queen Jennah to the Grove. Perhaps the queen will be sympathetic to Kasmeer\u0027s past family troubles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCanach was also present, acting as Anise\u0027s escort and bodyguard since she bought his billet. He\u0027s not technically a free man, having been previously incarcerated for his crimes on Southsun, but is serving out the rest of his term in a sort of work-release program for the countess. It\u0027s not entirely clear how Anise intends to employ him, though I overheard them talking about him being her \"eyes and ears\" in the field. I\u0027m not sure I trust him fully. He has a violent streak and is a bit unpredictable despite his claims of reform."
