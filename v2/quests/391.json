I met Marjory at the Durmand Priory\u0027s Special Collections to consult with Magister Ogden Stonehealer on the arcane ward blocking our access.\n\nOgden identified the barrier as made by an ancient serpent race called the Forgotten. As part of our research, Ogden broke the wax seal inside the old tome and the echo of a long-dead hero named Turai Ossa appeared. Marjory and I supported the echo as he retraced the Ascension trials, and in return, he gifted us with divine fire. Ogden believed the divine fire would open the seal on the mysterious cave, allowing us to continue retracing Caithe\u0027s past."
