Queen Jennah used the fanfare to introduce her watchknights—gilded mechanisms, crafted to protect the people of Divinity\u0027s Reach. Logan Thackeray valiantly stepped into the arena to spar with one. The whole thing was an odd show of force—on one hand, Anise was displaying her resourcefulness and wit in commissioning the creation of these mechanical wonders, and on the other we had the queen\u0027s most loyal defender and confidant who was likely trying to prove that he was still Her Majesty\u0027s most ardent sword hand.\n\nMidway through the demonstration, the watchknight malfunctioned and started going haywire, leaving Logan overwhelmed and the crowd distressed. Before we could intervene, the Aetherblades, the murderous pirates behind the Dragon Bash incident, ambushed us.\n\nA hooded figure mocked us from the sidelines; Rox attempted to snipe her, but she was fast. We eventually reached Logan and quelled the frenzied machine, but the hooded figure leapt back into the arena and mocked us again. Logan tried to strike her down, but his efforts were ineffective. The figure threatened to return before taking her leave.\n\nJennah refused to let someone dampen her message of resilience. Despite the city being on high alert, the festivities continued—with additional protection from the Seraph."
