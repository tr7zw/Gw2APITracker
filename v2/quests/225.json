Many of the wardens were kidnapped, including thair leader, Captain Banya. It\u0027s very strange...Malyck doesn\u0027t seem to have any memory of the Grove, or the Dream. I wanted to take him to the Pale Tree, but he was insistent about saving his kidnapped friends. Now, it\u0027s off to Joy\u0027s End to save the wardens and make the Nightmare Court pay for this attack."
