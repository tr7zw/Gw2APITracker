      "complete": "For my first duty as a Durmand Priory novice, I helped Scholar Krasso stage a conference to disseminate Gorr\u0027s theory. Rakt tried to burn the place down with everyone inside, but we dealt with him...only to have Councillor Flax of the Arcane Council admit that the council knew Gorr\u0027s theory was true all along and had been stifling the information until they figured out a way to exploit it. Zojja told me she was heading for Lion\u0027s Arch to meet up with an old friend, and since my new Durmand Priory mentor is also waiting in Lion\u0027s Arch, I told her I\u0027d look for her there."
