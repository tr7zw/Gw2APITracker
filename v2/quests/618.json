      "complete": "I was beckoned to the Eye of the North by Aurene. Recently, she\u0027s felt a presence in the invisible web of ley energy—\"like an echo in the Mists.\" Navigating the prophetic visions she inherited from Kralkatorrik, Aurene\u0027s concluded that all possible timelines converge into a singular event she can\u0027t see past—an event that will happen today. Ominous—given the last time this happened it ended with Aurene\u0027s death—but she seems surprisingly...relaxed. Am I wrong to worry?\nWhatever awaits us somehow involves Taimi and Gorrik. Gorrik\u0027s meeting an old colleague from the Inquest (no comment) whom Taimi has...thoughts on. She\u0027s asked me to accompany Gorrik at Lornar\u0027s pass and protect him. Or his virtue. Wasn\u0027t quite clear on that. Whether this is the anxious plea of a jealous heart or if Gorrik\u0027s in real danger, I can\u0027t say for certain. Somehow this all leads to Aurene\u0027s \"convergence of timelines,\" so I have no choice but to do as Taimi asks and see what happens."
