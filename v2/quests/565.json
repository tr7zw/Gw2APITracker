      "complete": "Jormag\u0027s whispers finally took Rytlock and Crecia, but fortunately I was able to incapacitate them before they did any serious harm. They\u0027ll be fine, I think. I hope. Drakkar ran out of hiding places, and Braham finally blasted it with the lost Spirits\u0027 power, destroying the beast."

      "complete": "Immediately after defeating Drakkar, the true source of the whispers emerged: a piece of Jormag. It nearly broke us, but Bangar appeared at the last possible moment and helped destroy it. I thought there might have been a chance of an alliance...until Bangar shot me with the bow."

He\u0027s taken credit for Drakkar\u0027s death, positioning himself as the only one capable of subjugating Jormag. And now the charr have begun to split apart. War is coming."
