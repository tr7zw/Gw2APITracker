But Smodur isn\u0027t one to extend mercy in warfare.\n\nAs a Dominion general, Ryland has proven formidable. Defectors are willing to sacrifice their lives just for the chance to join him. I fear that scores of charr will be lost in the conflict. Efram escorted us to a council meeting with Ryland, Smodur, Crecia, and Malice. Negotiations were interrupted by the arrival of Kasmeer and Logan, which drove Ryland from the table.\n\nTensions were high as the imperators debated how best to win the war. But it the end, Crecia, backed by Efram, suggested a combination approach. Even Smodur conceded to the plan, despite his grumbling."
