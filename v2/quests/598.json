We set out to find Braham, expecting to find his corpse but instead finding him very much alive underneath a pile of rubble. He was hurt—badly—but still breathing. I was ready to extract him to safety when Rytlock found Ryland at the far end of the valley. I made sure Braham was safe and then headed over to the commotion.\n\nRyland, angry from his loss and realizing that his ascent to greatness had ended in a fiery crash, had some harsh words for his parents. He refused to concede, and he let out all his pent-up anger with venomous rage. We tried to get him to surrender. When that didn\u0027t work, we tried to beat him into submission. We wanted to save what little was left of him, but he couldn\u0027t be saved. He lunged at Crecia, knife in hand, ready to end her life. Rytlock sprang into action, plunging Sohothin deep into his son\u0027s chest. He died almost instantly.\n\nHis father laid him on the hard ground, muttering to his son that it was over. My heart ached for them, but no other outcome was possible.\n\nThe rest of us let them grieve. Primordus and Jormag were both gone, and at least for now the magical imbalance was stabilizing. We\u0027d figured that Aurene had absorbed their magic, but we were wrong. The shock wave radiated outward, coursing through ley lines and permeating the air. But it didn\u0027t strike the Eye or the prismatic dragon. It went elsewhere, but to where?"
