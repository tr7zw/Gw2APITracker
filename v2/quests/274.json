A quaggan named Shashoo and the village elder, Varanos Narrijoo, confirmed that the villagers are vanishing, but the village can\u0027t move until their clutch of eggs hatch. This made Falooaloo easy prey for whatever is hunting them, so we set out to find the missing quaggan and solve this mystery."

These icebrood will continue to mass until they have the numbers to overwhelm the village, so we rededicated ourselves to protecting the village and giving the quaggan eggs time to hatch."
