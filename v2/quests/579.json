Smodur, on the other hand, was more than convinced it would be a waste of time and we should put all our resources into a single frontal assault.\n\nBut before I could make a decision, a bang echoed through the caverns. Smodur went down. Standing high above us: Ryland Steelcatcher, carrying the rifle that had done the deed.\n\nPortals opened around us, enemies pouring out."

If we could get that door open, we\u0027d have a straight shot right to Bangar. It was as good a plan as any."
