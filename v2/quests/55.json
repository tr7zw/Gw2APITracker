      "complete": "For my first duty as an Order of Whispers initiate, I helped Agent Batanga reprogram Rata Sum\u0027s Peacemaker golems to broadcast Gorr\u0027s theory far and wide. Rakt tried to kill us, but we dealt with him...only to have Councillor Flax of the Arcane Council admit that the council knew Gorr\u0027s theory was true all along and had been stifling the information until they figured out a way to exploit it. Zojja told me she was heading for Lion\u0027s Arch to meet up with an old friend, and since my new Order of Whispers mentor is also waiting in Lion\u0027s Arch, I told her I\u0027d look for her there."
