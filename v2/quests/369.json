      "complete": "The Arcane Council refused to attend the world summit without proof that Taimi\u0027s waypoint recalibration device would work. I agreed to help her acquire the components and resources necessary to complete the machine. After some scraps with elementals (who may have been attracted to the ley line\u0027s magical energy), I collected all the necessary items. Taimi got the device running and scanned the waypoint network, but was unable to immediately recalibrate the waypoints themselves since the network is so vast. She needs more time."
