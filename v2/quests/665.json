The captain hoped that our little group of heroes would be available to receive the nomadic group\u0027s leader, the Master of Peace. After some formalities, we were finally introduced and received compliments from both the captain and the Zephyrite master. They suggested we make ourselves seen at the various events being held to support the Lion\u0027s Arch relief effort, if only to drum up donations. Braham and Rox were quick to depart to the Crown Pavilion, while Taimi stuck with Marjory and Kasmeer, opting to visit the Labyrinthine Cliffs and the festivities there. As my new comrades went their separate ways, I felt as though we\u0027d finally turned the page on a new chapter."
