With Rytlock\u0027s help, Gahn and I defeated the necromancer Rissa and destroyed the dragon crystal...and put the undead monstrosity that used to be Howl the Brazen to rest. Gahn told me that my new Vigil mentor will be waiting for me in Lion\u0027s Arch, and I agreed to check in to begin my training as a Vigil recruit."
