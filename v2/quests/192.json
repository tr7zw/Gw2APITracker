If he fires the Sonic Vaporizer, it won\u0027t just destroy the Priory walls and kill Ogden Stonehealer: it will also attract a horde of ice dragon minions. As Eir suggested, I permanently joined an order and committed to stopping this threat as a fist step toward confronting the Elder Dragons themselves."
