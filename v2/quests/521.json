While some agreed the time had come to fight, others believed the better course would be to move the tribe and find a safer home.\n\nWhile the elders continued their discussions in private, Braham and Rox explored the village. Rox seemed particularly taken with the Olmakhan and their way of life. Meanwhile, I attempted to comfort a few of the cubs who had lost family to the Inquest\u0027s brutal experiments."

Braham and I escorted the cubs to safety and—with Aurene\u0027s help—fought to defend the villagers. The real test came with the deployment of the Inquest\u0027s colossal exterminator golem. We managed to defeat it, but sadly one of the elders didn\u0027t survive.\n\nThe village mourned their loss, and decided to avenge the elder\u0027s death by joining forces with us to take on Rata Primus."
