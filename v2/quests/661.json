I made the rounds at the camp near Vigil Keep. Taimi was there, questioning the refugees. I\u0027d never seen her so deflated. Her impression of Scarlet had changed a lot after she saw what the \"brilliant\" engineer was capable of and what she was willing to do. That said, there was something new about the progenyâ€”a fresh determination, a focus. Meanwhile, morale was low among the refugees, but the Lionguard and the Orders of Tyria were already poised and prepared for a counterattack. We were going to retake Lion\u0027s Arch.\n\n***"

Little by little we pushed back, cutting through Scarlet\u0027s forces and capturing key checkpoints throughout the city. After a heated struggle against a trio of Scarlet\u0027s upgraded watchknights, we secured the teleporters that would allow us to infiltrate the Breachmaker fortress above."
