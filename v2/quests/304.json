I was put in charge of a mortar team\u0027s fire mission, but when the smoke cleared, I saw we had been shelling our own troops. How could this have happened? I know I saw the enemy when I gave the order to fire. This could have catastrophic effects on the newly formed Pact\u0027s chain of command, so I decided my top priority is getting to the bottom of this."
