Kasmeer was still wary of her, but felt she was our best chance of catching Ankka.\n\nThe Ministry of Transit was a bureaucratic nightmare to which I wouldn\u0027t subject even my worst enemy. While waiting for my travel papers to clear, I opted to kill time by helping out around the island. Rama, grateful for the assistance, pulled some strings and got my paperwork expedited.\n\nWith everything in order, I was ready to set sail. Navan had some last-minute business to tend to in New Kaineng, so I swung by and picked her up before heading out."

      "complete": "New Kaineng City was truly a sight to behold. We met up with Marjory and Mai Trin at the docks. Navan split off to go handle her affairs while Marjory and I escorted Mai Trin to a nearby noodle stand. She had quite the hangover, and we deemed it best to feed her before putting her in front of people.\n\nThings got a little awkward on the way there. Mai tried to apologize for her actions and build some sort of rapport, but Marjory wasn\u0027t having any of it. Trust is earned through action, not words.\n\nSuddenly, distressed screams—a nearby loader mech had gone haywire. We neutralized it, and a jade-tech engineer arrived on the scene to assess the situation. The engineer\u0027s name was Yao, and according to them, these jade tech malfunctions had become more and more of a common occurrence in the past year. As if on cue, the jade spiders accompanying Yao started running amok as well—seemingly infected by the loader.\n\nAfter the battle, Yao gave me a jade bot of my own. (I hope it works better than the ones we beat.)"
