We found the fort ravaged by jungle tendrils and other creatures. I led the search party that rescued Lindsay and some of her colleagues before fending off the remaining attackers at Goldenlight Hallow lab. Tactician Art mentioned that the vines started sprouting from the ground shortly after a shipment of magical artifacts arrived. I\u0027m not sure of the connection there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRox made an offhand comment about Taimi. I think the kid is getting on her nerves."
