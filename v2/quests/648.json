While the city was occupied with Scarlet\u0027s invasion of Divinity\u0027s Reach, her clockwork beasts were tearing up the land outside.\n\nThankfully, by helping quell these threats we were able to gather more intel on Scarlet\u0027s portal technology and help Vorpp secure us a route into the Pavilion to rescue our friends and allies."
