      "complete": "Tonn\u0027s skill and bravery allowed us to sink the bone ship, but it cost him his life. When a mechanical failure prevented the charges from detonating, Tonn put himself at risk to make sure they went off. He succeeded, but was unable to get clear of the blast. His sacrifice saved hundreds of lives, but that won\u0027t be much comfort to his friends, his family, or those of us who fought beside him."
