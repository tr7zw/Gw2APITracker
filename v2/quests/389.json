      "complete": "I used a seed to enter Caithe\u0027s memory of the time she and Faolain saved a group of secondborn from asura. They found my old acquaintance Vorpp experimenting on the poor sylvari. Vorrp had the scare of his life, I suspect, and he learned that sylvari do not make good test subjects.\n\nAs they were leaving, Faolain announced her intention to travel to the Silverwastes in pursuit of Wynne who was going there to research Ventari with a centaur tribe. Caithe tried to discourage her from this, to no avail. I need to head back to Camp Resolve to see if any centaur have ever been found out in the Silverwastes."
