Professor Gorr presented his theory that the Elder Dragons consume magic, which was greeted with hostility. Gorr left to collect his research notes so he could convince the crowd, but he never came back. The Arcane Eye reported that Gorr had suddenly and conveniently died before he could return, but we were not convinced. I\u0027m going to look into Gorr\u0027s disappearance personally."
