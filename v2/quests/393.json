I planted the last memory seed and witnessed firsthand as Caithe discovered the secret the Pale Tree and Wynne had kept from Faolainâ€”all sylvari are linked to Mordremoth.\n\nTo prevent herself from breaking under torture, Wynne begged Caithe to end her life. In doing so, Caithe placed the burden of knowledge upon herself. I had no time to absorb this before we finally caught up with Caithe, who tried to reassure me of her intentions. Our confrontation was cut short by the Shadow of the Dragon. I killed Mordremoth\u0027s champion once and for all, but I was unable to secure the egg.\n\nSaving Glint\u0027s offspring is paramount to Tyria\u0027s survival against the Elder Dragons. I must recover it."
