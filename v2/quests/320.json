      "complete": "I joined Trahearne, Professor Gorr, and Scholar Vivian aboard a Pact airship to conduct tests on the dead Eye of Zhaitan without endangering anyone in Fort Trinity. We established that the Eye literally sees for Zhaitan, and we saw horrific images from Orr. We identified another monstrous creature called the Mouth of Zhaitan and agreed that if the Eye finds food for the dragon, then the Mouth must consume it. We set out for Orr itself to prevent the Mouth from providing sustenance to Zhaitan."
