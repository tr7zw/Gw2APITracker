We fought in areas that are being choked with gigantic, thorny vines. This merited further investigation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaimi seemed to be clashing with Rox over little things. She\u0027s a smart kid who means well; we just have to remember she\u0027s a child. She\u0027s talks about Braham like he\u0027s her big brother, which is probably good considering her situation. Braham\u0027s leg seems to have healed since the Scarlet fight."
