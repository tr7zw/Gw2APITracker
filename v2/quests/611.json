She had visitors, and I knew this was important.\n\nI walked in to find members of the Arcane Council bickering over the current situation, trying to deflect the blame for their Elder Dragon research resulting in Jormag getting the upper hand. They framed it as all in service of protecting themselves from the fire dragon threat, but anyone who was paying attention knew that their plan would cause collateral damage. Both Ryland and Braham had been wreaking havoc around Tyria. The loss of life was incalculable.\n\nRegardless, we needed to end the current conflict as quickly as possible. Since the two Elder Dragons, Jormag and Primordus, are siblings (two faces of the same coin, some have said) we need them to focus their might against each other. Neither would naturally face the other in combat, so we\u0027d have to lure them to the same spot and force them to fight somehow.\n\nLey lines course throughout Tyria like veins and arteries. Elder Dragons feed off ley-line magic, so the key would be to find a nexus where ley lines intersect and lure them to that spot. Then we\u0027d use their champions—Ryland and Braham—to redirect the flow of magic away from the dragons and somehow use it against them, using prismaticite to change it. We cut the dragons off from their magic \"food\" supply, and they\u0027d be forced to clash with each other for sustenance. This plan was crazy enough that it might work, but we had little time to ponder it before heading to the battlefield."
