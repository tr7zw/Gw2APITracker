      "complete": "Based off information Taimi sent me, I headed to the Iron Marches to investigate reports of Mordrem activity. Vines and other plant creatures have been sighted as far east as Ascalon, choking everything in their path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI assisted the charr and defended the area around Monger\u0027s Sink, killing Mordrem and helping soldiers where I could. I acquired samples of dragon minion tissue that may help us understand our enemy. Brutus Rendflesh sent me a Mordrem seed to keep. I may be able to cultivate it into something useful, but I\u0027ll probably need a variety of materials."
