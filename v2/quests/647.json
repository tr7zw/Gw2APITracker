The Lionguard are decoding messages all throughout the area, containing vital information on the whereabouts of the Aetherblades\u0027 base. With that information in hand, we were able to track down its location. Turns out they were hiding in Lion\u0027s Arch all along, tucked away in a cave southwest of the city. Looks like Kiel and I know where we\u0027re headed next."
