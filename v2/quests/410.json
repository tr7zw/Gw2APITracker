We fought our way in and destroyed the camp\u0027s ability to take and process new prisoners, but at a terrible cost: Eir Stegalkin. Betrayed and wounded by Faolain during the escape, Eir fell in combat with a Vinetooth, Mordremoth\u0027s elite hunter-killer. Braham stayed behind to perform funeral rites while I and the rest of my team pressed deeper into the jungle. In Eir\u0027s name, and to honor her memory, we are going to complete our mission and destroy Mordremoth."
