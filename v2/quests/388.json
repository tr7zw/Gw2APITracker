I found the first location in the Grove itself and saw Caithe and the firstborn over twenty years ago. They were discussing the recent arrival of the secondborn and wondering how to deal with them.\n\nA half-naked secondborn interrupted the discussion to let us know that his friends had been captured by \"imps.\" At the end of the memory, Caithe and Faolain—yes, the leader of the Nightmare Court today—were racing off to rescue them. I believe the second memory seed location will be in Metrica Province, where the secondborn were taken."
