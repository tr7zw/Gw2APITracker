      "complete": "Zojja expressed interest in my very first invention, the Infinity Ball. It was supposed to predict the future, but I never got it to work exactly right. Now Zojja\u0027s interested in taking a crack at it, which I view as a huge compliment. I also met a fellow inventor named Shodd, who agreed to collaborate with me to perfect the Infinity Ball ourselves. This is a chance to redeem my first invention and test myself against Zojja, one of our greatest living geniuses, so I accepted Shodd\u0027s offer. We made plans to visit the Megahedron Collider to begin our work on the improved Infinity Ball."

      "complete": "Shodd set up a test for my Infinity Ball at the Megahedron Collider, but the results were...problematic. After the collider supercharged the Infinity Ball, a portal opened up and strange mechanized monsters came pouring out. We took care of them, and despite some serious misgivings on my part, Shodd and I agreed to continue with our testsâ€”in a much safer and more remote location."
