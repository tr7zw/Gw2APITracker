We found evidence: Queen Salma\u0027s chalice, floor plans of ransacked properties, and a letter from Zamon\u0027s sister, Lady Madeline, hinting at his suspicious activities. Zamon returned from the party as we were leaving, and Thackeray called him to trial right then and there, making our accusations both public and official."
