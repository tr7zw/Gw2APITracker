We were attacked as soon as I presented my concerns, but I was able to stop the mesmer\u0027s assassination attempt. This matter will have to wait, however, as Trahearne told me Fort Trinity is being targeted for a major assault by Zhaitan\u0027s forces. I agreed to meet Trahearne back at Fort Trinity to prepare for this assault."
