Teyo fell, but the translocator was destroyed in the fighting. At least I was able to claim the Snaff Savant title, which everyone who matters agreed was mine by right. Zojja seemed pleased with the results, though it\u0027s often hard to tell with her. In any case, I have been confirmed as the Snaff Savant and I\u0027m prepared for whatever challenges lie ahead."
