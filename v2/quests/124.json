I had it under control until the Ministry Guard showed up, and Commander Serentine tried to arrest me along with the troublemakers. Luckily, Captain Thackeray vouched for me. My friend Andrew, the tavern keeper, was injured in the fight. Thackeray sent me to Lieutenant Francis for medicine from Seraph supplies."
