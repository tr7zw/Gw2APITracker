It was too weakened to defend the temple from a powerful Risen, so we made an exchange: we defeated the Risen, and the Reaper gave us the information we were looking for. Apparently, there is an artesian well hidden beneath the moutain near Melandru\u0027s temple, the very spot where the gods first set foot upon Tyria. There, we\u0027ll find the source of Orr."
