The tests all ended violently, but in the process we learned a few of the amulet\u0027s secrets: each piece of the crystal is connected, each piece is dangerous, and the pieces react violently to certain alchemical potions. We then decided to return to check in with Rytlock and the other order reps to share what we\u0027ve learned."

We all agreed the amulets were even more dangerous than we first suspected, and decided my next step is to continue working with the orders to find the amulets we know about before they can do any more harm."
