We also agreed that I would be Trahearne\u0027s second in command with the rank of commander. We put the finest smiths in Tyria to work making weapons and armor for the Pact, and Trahearne led a rescue mission that not only saved the lives of stranded Pact soldiers, but also netted us a valuable dwarven tome of ancient knowledge. The Pact\u0027s campaign plans are broad and complicated, so Trahearne asked me to make sure a key element of that campaign is ready for the rigors of war."
