I encountered a squad of restless spirits who had died violently during the prior Mordrem attack. They were traumatized in their last moments and mistook me for the enemy, so I had to put them down.\n\nExplorer Campbell was nearly killed by Marjory\u0027s departed sister, Belinda. Thanks to Marjory\u0027s intervention, though, Explorer Campbell\u0027s life was spared. The sisters exchanged words before Belinda performed a ritual that bound her soul with her sword. Now Marjory has a powerful ancestral weapon to train with, and her sister is at rest."
