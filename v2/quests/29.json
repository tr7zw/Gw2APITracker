We found one in a merchant\u0027s stall in Rata Sum, though I don\u0027t think he realized what he had. Zojja did some fast talking to distract the merchant, and I collected the object. With the VOED and Zojja on my side, I decided to press on and find the next piece."

We deduced that there are only three pieces of the artifact in all: the two we have plus the one the Inquest extorted from us. We decided that in order to complete our collection and assemble the full artifact, we would have to take back the Inquest\u0027s piece by force."
