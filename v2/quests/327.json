The mission was a success, but only due to the bravery and sacrifice of our pilot, Arda Gyreshriek. Arda went missing after the blast, so Laranthir of the Wild and I set out to find her and bring her home safely."

We have little time to mourn her loss; the invasion of Orr is far from over. Laranthir promised to add Arda\u0027s name to the roster of honored dead while I returned to Trahearne for my next mission."
