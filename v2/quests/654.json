Kasmeer was sent by the Mesmer Collective—a mysterious, low-profile society of powerful magic users—to investigate and disarm whatever illusion or veil was covering it up.\n\nWhen I first arrived at the scene, it was hard to ignore the barbed, rugged tower at the center of the lake. It looked like a krait structure, with a massive spore fixed at the height of the spire. Shortly after my arrival, I was greeted by a Sergeant Walters of the Seraph. She had strict orders to escort me to Kasmeer and Marjory in the ruins nearby. As we navigated the toxic landscape, we were attacked by krait and members of the Nightmare Court.\n\nSpores lined our path, and whatever toxins they\u0027re emitting not only affected the environment but our minds. On our way to the rendezvous point, Sergeant Walters was overcome with mania and started attacking the escort group, claiming we were all rampaging centaurs. We were able to quell her frenzy, so I headed to Kasmeer and Marjory while Walters stayed behind to tend to the wounded.\n\nAfter securing the shore from wandering krait and Nightmare Court, I finally reached Kasmeer and Marjory hiding at the edge of the lake. Kasmeer cast a spell that revealed a tower of nightmares. It\u0027s surrounded by a thick plume of toxins, and we can\u0027t get inside until we have some way to do it safely."
