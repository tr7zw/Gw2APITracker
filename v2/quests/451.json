Unlike the poor quaggans and kodan I found there, I survived my encounter with it and got out without being corrupted or frozen to death. I have Taimi\u0027s sample, and now I\u0027m headed back. I\u0027ll stop in Sorrow\u0027s Eclipse on the way to let them know I found their herd mates. What a tragedy."
