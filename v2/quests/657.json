As we approached the mass, Scarlet finally graced us with her presence. She gallantly admitted to her hand in the chaos to date: her alliances, the devastation at Dragon Bash. It was all Scarlet, and the Nightmare Tower is simply the latest of her cruel games.\n \nWe were ambushed by a krait-turned-beast, a monstrous creation of the Toxic Alliance. With the beast defeated, we were finally able to inject the antitoxin—but the heart barely squirmed. It looks like it will take more than one dose to bring down the tower after all."
