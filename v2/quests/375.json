      "complete": "I met my team at the Grove and represented the Pact for the world summit. I convinced Knut Whitebear, Queen Jennah, Councillor Phlunt, and Smodur the Unflinching that we need to unite against Mordremoth. However, the summit was cut short when the Shadow of the Dragon attacked the Pale Tree in the Omphalos Chamber. Before she fell unconscious, the Pale Tree showed me a vision of a golden land and a mysterious artifact. I\u0027m not sure what it means just yet.\n\nI overheard Countess Anise and Canach having a discussion. She wants him to infiltrate the Pact staging area and learn what he can about their preparations in the fight against Mordremoth.\n\nOne thing is certainly clear now: Mordremoth is gaining power by the day. Its tendrils are spreading at an alarming rate. No one is safe. It\u0027s my mission to decipher the vision and stop the dragon before it consumes everything."
