      "complete": "I got Braham released from the brig, but things quickly went south. We discovered he\u0027d somehow lost his bow. Then Rytlock called in to report disturbing signs of racial tensions and violence among his fellow charr. With Braham heading off to track down his bow, Rytlock and I met with Bangar and Crecia about the undercurrent of racial hostility among some of the charr at the celebration. Violence had already broken out in some quarters, and Rytlock worried that an escalation could endanger the treaty between the charr and the other races. Bangar\u0027s reaction quickly got personalâ€”he and Rytlock seem to have some very old, very bad blood between them. Their confrontation came to blows, but in the end Rytlock had the good sense to walk away. When we left Bangar\u0027s office, Crecia suggested that Rytlock and I find solid evidence of a threat so she could help argue our case. Before we could begin, however, Kasmeer called in and asked me to meet with her and the Flame \"imperator,\" Efram Greetsglory, right away."
