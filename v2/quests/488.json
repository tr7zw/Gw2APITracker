She mentioned \"common interests,\" which to me says the reports I\u0027ve been hearing about refugees coming in from the Crystal Desert are true. It seems the Captain\u0027s Council and the Lionguard are working overtime to deal with the influx.\nThe incoming refugees describe an army marauding in the area, and that, coupled with the vision I received from the Eye of Janthir, tells me Balthazar is the cause. Not long ago, my guild and I stopped his plans to kill two Elder Dragons, but it\u0027s clear he\u0027s not done trying. He\u0027s after Kralkatorrik now, so I\u0027m headed to Lion\u0027s Arch to discuss the situation with Kiel."
