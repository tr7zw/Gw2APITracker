Marjory tasked me with collecting toxic spores from across the region, and with those spores in hand, she was able to successfully create an antitoxin to counter the plume of toxic discharge inside of the tower. Priory researchers are going to attempt to quell the tower by injecting the antitoxin into the chamber at the tower\u0027s core, but we\u0027ve yet to see or hear if that effort will be at all successful."
