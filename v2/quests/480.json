The sylvari mercenary says he placed a large bet on my surviving this endeavor, and he\u0027s agreed to rejoin our team temporarily in order to protect his investment."

He wasn\u0027t sure why, but he did steer me toward the Forged encampments near the Temple of Kormir to the northeast. \nThe answers we need are out there in the desert, so I ordered my team to split up and search. Kasmeer headed to Kormir\u0027s temple to gather information, while Rytlock and Canach went to reconnoiter the main Forged camp. That leaves the two smaller Forged encampments to me."
