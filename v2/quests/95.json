Klaes was corrupted and insane and had to be put down, but we did establish a connection between the amulet and the sudden surge of undead. Korukhan and I decided to check in with Rytlock and the other order reps before we proceed."

We decided that more information was required, so I agreed continue to work with all three orders to dig deeper into this mystery."
