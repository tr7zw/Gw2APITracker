He tasked us with creating a diversion while Malice Swordshadow got word to Ryland that Cinder had been captured.\n\nAfter a mission, Smodur gave us a crystal, which we infused with a Flame Core. Later, when Rytlock and I got to a Dominion supply bunker, Smodur urged us to drop it down the vent. As soon as I heard the explosion, I knew it was a mistakeâ€”one Rytlock and I will live with forever. Smodur, on the other hand, didn\u0027t even flinch at the loss of life. In the wreckage we found an Ash agent with orders to defect. Orders from Malice Swordshadow."
