We did manage to save the quaggans themselves, including all their newly hatched eggs, and we secured the villagers\u0027 help for the coming war against the Elder Dragons. It wasn\u0027t a complete victory by any stretch, but it\u0027ll have to do: the threat of the dragons grows stronger each and every day."
