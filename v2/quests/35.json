Once again, the test results were promising, but also unpredictable and dangerous. The Infinity Ball created an unstable portal from which emerged more hideously twisted creatures. We decided to return to my lab to determine how (and if) we should proceed."

Undaunted, Shodd was still determined to go forward, and I agreed: this close to a breakthrough, a bit more risk is worth the reward. All we need is a very strong, very stable power source...and Shodd said he knew just where to get one."
