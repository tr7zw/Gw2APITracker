I met with Detective Rama at the training grounds to prove I\u0027d be able to survive on my own, and after a short—but chatty—boat ride, I joined up with my friends to check on Aurene.\n\nAurene was still exhausted from our encounter with the Aetherblades—the weapon they used somehow drained her magic! I caught her a fish to snack on in the hopes of cheering her up a bit, but seeing her like this...well, it was a harsh reminder that we don\u0027t have the faintest idea what the Aetherblades are capable of. Rama told me I\u0027d need permission from Empress Ihn to investigate them. There is no time to waste; luckily, Kas already has a meeting on the books.\n\n***"

      "complete": "The meeting with the empress was dominated by verbal sniping between Madam Joon, the apparent creator of jade tech, and Minister Li. There is much about Canthan politics I don\u0027t yet understand, but as far as I could tell, Li believes Joon put Cantha\u0027s security at risk for the sake of expanding the market for her technology. Joon believes Li is too closed-minded.\n\nKasmeer is quickly growing into her new role as an ambassador. Even among all that heated debate, we were able to secure permission from the empress to investigate the Aetherblades. I also had the opportunity to meet Joon face-to-face afterward—she\u0027s incredibly knowledgeable. Unsurprisingly, she and Taimi bonded quickly. Joon expressed an interest in helping treat Aurene, which...well, it seems a little soon to trust a stranger with that. Perhaps we\u0027ll revisit the matter once the Aetherblade situation is handled."
