Ogden resides inside the Durmand Priory itself, so the whole thing could be in danger.

If he fires the Sonic Vaporizer, it won\u0027t just destroy the Priory walls and kill Ogden Stonehealer: it will also attract a horde of ice dragon minions. As Eir suggested, I permanently joined an order and committed to stopping this threat as a fist step toward confronting the Elder Dragons themselves."
