      "complete": "We disembarked in an underground cavern that was less than hospitable and began initial explorations. The Vigil sent scouts out to form a perimeter, but we\u0027ve already lost crew members to hostile vegetation and creaturesâ€”including Taimi\u0027s scientist Viraddi, who had the tracker on him! I have to find him. This is not going to be easy."

      "complete": "Even the bushes are suspicious in this strange landscape. Thank goodness I was able to rescue most of the endangered scouts and Viraddi. Unfortunately, Taimi\u0027s tracking device was damaged beyond repair. Looks like I\u0027ll be relying on my own abilities from now on. I met a barely friendly nature spirit who informed me that Balthazar is at the top of this cavern. I must hurry."
