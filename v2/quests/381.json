We discussed the planned assault on Mordremoth, and he requested that I lead a small extraction team to retrieve Caithe\u0027s squad in the Silverwastes around Camp Resolve.\n\nBraham, Taimi, and I met briefly. He agreed to keep an eye on Taimi, who was inquiring with the Aspect Masters on the whereabouts of the Master of Peace. They answered her questions reluctantly, though it seemed as if they may have been withholding some details. \n\nAfterward, Taimi introduced herself to Brun Ingotspotter, a noted metalworker who may be able to help her fix her golem Scruffy. It had previously taken some damage in Dry Top when the Inquest tried to steal the Waypoint Recalibration Device from her."
