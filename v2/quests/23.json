      "complete": "Mr. Sparkles and I fought our way into the Funhouse to rescue Zojja. Once inside, we found she had the Inquest goons who took her either on the run or unconscious, so you could also say we rescued them from her. In any case, we helped Zojja get out of the facility and destroyed the Inquest\u0027s vile incinerator golem, into which they had been feeding test subjects who had outlived their usefulness. Then Zojja informed us that our krewe chief Varkk had been working with the Inquest all along, and that the Inquest had kidnapped Pol. I had to decide: rescue my friend and krewemate Pol, or see that the traitor Varkk gets what he deserves?"
