      "complete": "With an enraged, wounded Kralkatorrik overhead and Aurene backing me up, I squared off for the final showdown against Balthazar. It was brutal, but with Sohothin in hand and Aurene on my side, I prevailed. The god of fire and war is dead.\nHowever, even in death, Balthazar managed to disrupt the world\u0027s balance. As he fell, all the magic he had acquired erupted out of his broken body and was promptly absorbed by both Kralkatorrik and Aurene. Once this magical storm subsided, both the Crystal Elder Dragon and its scion were gone. \nSo this victory planted the seeds of our next dire challenge: How will we deal with two unpredictable and dangerously powerful dragons, now that they\u0027ve gorged themselves on Balthazar\u0027s magic?\nI don\u0027t have the answers yet, but my team and I are going to regroup in Amnoon to figure out our next move."
