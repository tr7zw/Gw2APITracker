      "complete": "I received an invitation from Blood Legion Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer for a celebration in honor of Kralkatorrik\u0027s demise. Rytlock, Braham, and Gorrik also accepted the invitation to the Blood Legion homelands, and we were delighted when Kas and Jory decided to join as well. Tribune Crecia Stoneglow, Bangar\u0027s head of security and clearly an old friend of Rytlock\u0027s, escorted us to Bangar\u0027s opening ceremony. Rytlock and Crecia\u0027s history got a little clearer when an impressive young centurion taking part in the ceremony turned out to be their son, Ryland. The ceremony went awry, however, when Aurene made an unexpected appearance, shocking the charr in attendance and clearly angering Bangar. Crecia asked that we spend some time mingling with the attendees and check in with the other imperators to try and ease any anxieties."
