Canach\u0027s explosives brought down the bone wall, along with the ceiling of the chamber. We would have been smashed if Braham and Rox hadn\u0027t appeared and saved us.\n\nI can only hope Braham is ready to cooperate with us now."

We found Taimi just in time to see an Awakened army pass through the gates into a range of locations in Tyria. \n\nWe were greeted by a chorus of Awakened asura, who delivered a vengeful message from Joko and revealed that Taimi was trapped inside her golem, Scruffy, which had been rigged to suffocate her.\n\nOur only choice now is to take down Scruffy and get Taimi out of there before it\u0027s too late."

She\u0027s clearly weakened and frightened from the experience, but she insists she will be okay.\n\nWe asked Taimi what she learned while she was with Joko, and it sounds like he\u0027s researching bugs of some kind. We\u0027ll need to figure out where he is so we can stop him for good."
