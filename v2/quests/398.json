We found and saved our friends, but they weren\u0027t in any shape to continue, so I sent them to safety with Kasmeer and Rox. Caithe showed up, and despite my initial misgivings, she fought alongside us as we pursued Faolain on the way to where Trahearne was being held. We finally gave that warped abomination payback for Eir\u0027s murder.  And although Faolain\u0027s dead, we missed saving Trahearne. Mordremoth yanked him out of our grasp at the last moment.  It\u0027s time to free the marshal and end the dragon."
