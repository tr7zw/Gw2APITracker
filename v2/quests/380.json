      "complete": "Explorer Campbell, the researcher we rescued at Fort Salma, provided us with a cipher that gained us access to the Durmand Priory\u0027s inner research facilities. Once inside, we explored the library before making our way into the Special Collections room, which was packed from floor to ceiling with rare antiquities and artifacts.\n\nWe met up with Ogden Stonehealer, who had been hard at work researching dragon history. At his request, we handled a mysterious hourglass and were unexpectedly transported to Glint\u0027s Lair. I explored its wondrous paths, putting down the creatures in our way. Whether they were guardians of the lair, or simply manifestations created by the magic that was freed upon Glint\u0027s death, I am unsure. I did, however, see echoes of past events. The Master of Peace had visited the lair before us, and he found what appeared to be Glint\u0027s remaining egg.\n\nWe returned to the Priory and discussed our findings with Ogden. Now more than ever, it is crucial that we find the Master of Peace and help him protect Glint\u0027s egg before Mordremoth seeks to destroy it."
