We helped a local tribe of Itzel hylek fight off a Mordrem attack, and in return they shared their extensive knowledge of the region and provided two of their best scouts to help us track down our missing comrades. We\u0027re going to meet these new allies at the entrance to Auric Basin and then head deeper into the jungle."
