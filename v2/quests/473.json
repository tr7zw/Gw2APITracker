Neither she nor Anise would tell me what they intend to do with the aspects, so I agreed to take the Shining Blade Oath of Confidence. It makes me an honorary member of the Blade, and I am now privileged to hear the deeper secrets of the Shining Blade. The oath bound me to silence on those matters with any outsiders—on penalty of a magically activated death, but I got what I wanted. Kerida plans to use the aspects to resurrect Lazarus just so she can put him down for good. It\u0027s a crazy plan!"
