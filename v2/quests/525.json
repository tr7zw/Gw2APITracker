      "complete": "We found ourselves in an Inquest lab full of signs of disease research on live subjects, including members of a local tribe of charr. We helped liberate one of these charr before Inquest researchers infected her with a mysterious and deadly disease. \n\nThe charr\u0027s escape triggered a self-destruct sequence. As we hurried to find our way out in time, we battled security forces and discovered a garbled distress message from Blish\u0027s brother, Gorrik. The message confirmed that Joko\u0027s Awakened were wreaking havoc in the Rata Primus main complex.\n\nAs we reached the roof to make our escape, we got our first glimpse of Rata Primus in the distanceâ€”a massive floating cube. We jumped from the lab\u0027s roof to avoid the lab\u0027s self-destruction, but it was clear we\u0027d have to storm that cube if we had any hope of stopping Joko\u0027s invasion of Tyria."
