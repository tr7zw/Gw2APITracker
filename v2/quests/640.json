The countryside is currently littered with Molten Alliance attacksâ€”villages raided, homesteaders and charr being taken left and right. The Orders are working tirelessly to tame the chaos, but the Molten Alliance grows stronger by the hour.\n\nThe Order of Whispers partnered with the Vigil to locate the Molten Alliance\u0027s base of operations. Brandubh\u0027s partner is currently undercover as Flame Legion, gathering intel on their goals and whereabouts. She\u0027s been leaving dead drops all over the countryside with vital information, ready for us to decode. The intel was scattered about the countryside, but Brandubh had a rough idea about where the messages were tucked away. The information they contained would have been deadly in the wrong hands.\n\nWith the dead drops in hand, the Order was able to determine the location of the Molten Alliance base. They\u0027ve been operating out of an old dredge mine right beneath our feet. We\u0027re getting a small strike group together to get the prisoners out, maybe see what else we can learn inside."
