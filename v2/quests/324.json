Zhaitan has fallen, and while the Pact\u0027s work is far from over, we have achieved a major victory. We agreed to continue the fight against the remaining Elder Dragons after we take a moment to honor those who have fallen and celebrate this triumph."

The Pact stood triumphant, but we did not delude ourselves. Swarms of Risen still roam Tyria, and there are four more Elder Dragons to contend with. We knew that soon we would once again rise up to defend our world, but that didn\u0027t stop us from taking this opportunity to savor a well-earned victory."
