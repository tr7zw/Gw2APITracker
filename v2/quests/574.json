They showed me firsthand just how desperate things are for our troops on the front line. Retaking territory held by Ryland\u0027s Steel warband isn\u0027t easy because it\u0027s not just the Dominion we\u0027re up against. The environment is hostile, morale is low, and there\u0027s a chance soldiers just might find one of their warband mates firing at them from the other side of the battlefield. How long can we expect the troops to live under these conditions? Hopefully we won\u0027t have to find out. While executing missions for Crecia, Rytlock and I recovered intel on a secret Steel command base somewhere in Breakroot Basin."
