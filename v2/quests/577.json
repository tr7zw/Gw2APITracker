Smodur was keen on a direct frontal assault with his artillery paving the path toward victory, but Braham had another idea: investigate the norn ruins directly underneath the keep.\n\nTurns out the ruins were built to honor the Spirits of the Wild, marking their first interactions with the norn race. A large stone door would get us in, if only Braham could find a way to open it."
