Together, we worked to clear the sanctuary of its current inhabitants: A horde of spiders led by a terrifying broodmother. After defeating the spiders, we relit Kormir\u0027s protection fire inside the Chamber of the Sun—which will protect the inner chamber from Kralkatorrik\u0027s attacks—and gave our reclaimed sanctuary a new name: Sun\u0027s Refuge.\n"

And they came with a message for Aurene from Glint herself: the time has come for Aurene to defeat Kralkatorrik and replace it as an Elder Dragon.\n\nBacked into a corner, Aurene revealed a vision to us showing multiple scenarios of our attempts to defeat Kralkatorrik. The battles were horrific—in every outcome, Aurene dies. Terrified, Aurene fled, leaving us reeling without her. Just then, Blish piped up with a sudden idea to enter the Mists and attach a tracker to Kralkatorrik, using it to evacuate villages before he appears. Blish has tasked me with with step one: track down Balthazar\u0027s sword to use as bait. It\u0027s rumored to be somewhere in Vabbi."
