She filled the Crown Pavilion to the brim with Aetherblades and her horrific clockwork creatures. First, we located Faren and Scarlet\u0027s other captives. While they watched in horror, Scarlet slowly brought Faren to a steady boil inside of a fiery cauldron. He shrieked for relief while we attempted to quell the flames; Scarlet eventually conceded and retreated further into her \"playhouse.\"\n\n***"

Before our fight began, she threatened me if I didn\u0027t stop meddling in her plans. As our weapons clashed, she utilized every trick available in that arena. She almost succumbed, but Scarlet knew when to pull back. She stared me down, noting my role in foiling her operation before fleeing the city for her own safety.\n\nScarlet keeps a short list of people who\u0027ve gotten in her way, and guess who just earned their place at the top."
