It\u0027s possible that the merchant had sold the Master of Peace some supplies, and the saboteur demanded information. We\u0027ll probably never know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found a frightened woman inside the mine who witnessed the murder. She said the killer was chasing the Master of Peace, and that I should head toward Spurbend Canyon. I read the torn pages from Aerin\u0027s defaced copy of a Zephyrite manuscript, and followed the trail to the top of a ridge where I will meet my friends."
