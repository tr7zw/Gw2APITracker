      "complete": "After resting my eyes on the winding train ride to Gyala Delve, I woke up and met with Rama and Gorrik to investigate the area and question the Brotherhood crew. As the two of them tended to a fallen miner, a scream drew me to Yao, who was being attacked by a haywire mech.\n\nOnce I powered the mech down, Yao reprogrammed it and filled me in on some rumors. I continued to question more of the Brotherhood crew members, but their responses ran the gamut from ridiculous to rude to downright bafflingâ€”whispers, complaints, people talking backward...\n\nAnother scream led me to Jade Brotherhood leader Chul-Moo, who\u0027d been attacked by one of his own crew, Jin-Lee. We were forced to fight his attacker since Chul-Moo had been hesitant to defend himself, not wanting to injure his own crew.\n\nIt was unclear if Chul-Moo had done something to anger Jin-Lee or if there was some other reason for his aggression. Yao convinced Chul-Moo to investigate further, and the two of them headed deeper into the mine."
