We collected the head of their most recent champion as proof that the sacrifices aren\u0027t saving the village. Instead, the champions are being corrupted and joining Zhaitan\u0027s undead army. The village leaders were not convinced, however, so we decided to make our case again from a much stronger position so that no one could possibly deny the truth."
