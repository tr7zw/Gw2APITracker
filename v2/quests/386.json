I let them know that I will be striking out on my own leads instead of being a part of the main frontal assault. Although they were disappointed to hear the news, they understood my reasons.\n\nI met up with my friends afterward to discuss where the Aspect Masters were headed. Luckily, Taimi caught sight of them heading out of camp by the southwestern gate. Caithe started following me around after she learned of Glint\u0027s egg. She seems focused on it."
