I called for a world summit to rally forces against the Elder Dragon, and the Pale Tree graciously agreed to host.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBraham, Kasmeer, and Rox agreed to appeal to the leaders of their home cities, though each expressed personal hesitation. Kasmeer\u0027s family was stripped of its titles after her father was incarcerated, leaving her with a mark of shame and limited clout. Braham has had an uneasy relationship with his mother, Eir, since she left him in his father\u0027s care when he was young. Rox disobeyed orders to kill Scarlet and chose to tend to Braham and the others during our battle aboard the Breechmaker. Her actions could be viewed as treasonous, so she\u0027s not looking forward to seeing Rytlock."
