We drove her off, but not without casualties. \nAfter our work was done, the grateful villagers gave us raptor mounts to aid us in our travels across the vast desert expanses. I rode mine to the gates of the port city Amnoon, where two of my guildmates were ready and waiting: Kasmeer Meade and Rytlock Brimstone. \nKasmeer has come to learn the truth about Balthazar\u0027s campaign and to confront the crisis of faith his actions have caused her. Rytlock, as usual, was less forthcoming about his reasons for being here, but I trust that when he says he\u0027s here to follow my lead in taking down Balthazar, he means it. \nFor now, that\u0027s enough. But soon, Rytlock is going to have to come clean about the secrets he\u0027s been keeping."
