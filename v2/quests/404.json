      "complete": "My allies and I found Marshal Trahearne and, with his help, entered Mordremoth\u0027s mind for a final confrontation. The Jungle Dragon\u0027s mental and magical defenses were formidable, but we prevailed. Defeated, Mordremoth survived inside Trahearne, and there was no way to finish off the dragon without also killing the marshal. At his urging and with great regret, I ended Trahearne\u0027s life and destroyed Mordremoth once and for all. The dragon\u0027s death sent an enormous wave of magical energy across the entire jungle; it remains to be seen what effect this wave will have on the region, and the entire world."
