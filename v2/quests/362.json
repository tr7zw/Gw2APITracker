Wreckage and bodies were strewn about the canyon, making it difficult to piece together the sequence of events. We learned of a Soundless sylvari named Aerin who attacked the ship\u0027s crew and set off the explosives that ultimately took down the aircraft. We have reason to believe this murderous saboteur is after the Master of Peace, who has been missing. I should head to the nearby mining town, Prosperity, to see if he\u0027s there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKasmeer worried that Marjory still hadn\u0027t healed from the fight against Scarlet, but her fears were put to rest after Marjory held her own in our repeated fights against the Inquest operatives at the crash site."
