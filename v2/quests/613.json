It\u0027s hard to know whether to trust Joon\u0027s sudden turn, but at this point we have no choice. Hopefully we have earned her trust in both our intentions and abilities and can work together from here on out. Hope is unfortunately all we have right now. If Soo-Won manages to escape beyond the borders of Cantha, she will carry the Void with her and spread it everywhere. That cannot happen.\n\n***"

Ayumi came on behalf of the Kestrels, Ivan represented the reformed Aetherblades, and Detective Rama, well, he just came on his own. But it seems the Ministry of Security will back us up as well. Caithe relayed how pressed our forces are in the Jade Sea—we needed to act quickly, for their sake.\n\nIt was decided that Ayumi and Ivan would join Canach and Sayida in patrolling the coast, and the rest of us would head to the Jade Sea to arrange the newly completed extractors, helping in the fight as we were able.\n\n***"

      "complete": "We arrived in Jade Sea to find a true war zone. Caithe had not exaggerated their circumstances. Our troops were worn thin, and their frustrations mounted as every time someone managed to strike a Void beast down, another re-formed in its place.\n\nBut after more than a few battles, we got the extractors in place and then rendezvoused at the Harvest Temple. Our prospects are grim, but defeat is even grimmer. Either the Dragon Cycle ends today, or we do."
