      "complete": "There\u0027s a pass through the mountains between Frostgorge Sound and the Bitterfrost Frontier, but it\u0027s guarded by a kodan. I convinced her that my mission was important enough that I be allowed entrance, and she gave me a magical torch that brought down the icy barrier and let me through."

      "complete": "Bitterfrost Frontier is one of the most naturally inhospitable places I\u0027ve ever visited. It\u0027s inconceivable that anyone but Svanir choose to live here. I spoke with the kodan and quaggan leaders at Sorrow\u0027s Eclipse, and they advised me to speak with the quaggan shaman. The shaman warned me of the extreme cold at my destination, suggesting I speak with the Svanir who have some magical means to survive it. I have a plan to find out how they do it."
