So I intervened. Ryland\u0027s commitment to his mission was steadfast, but so was his loyalty to Cinder. Just when Crecia was making Ryland see reason, about to force another compromise through her sheer force of will, Smodur executed Cinder.\n\nAny chance we had to bring Ryland in was lost along with Cinder\u0027s lifeblood. Ryland fled, and we gave chase...directly into Bangar\u0027s Frost Legion forces.\n\nOnce charr, but not any longer. Now they\u0027re proof Bangar\u0027s close to waking Jormag. They set upon us with overwhelming firepower. In the end, we were forced back across the river, our spirits even more battered than our bodies.\n\nMalice revealed that her Ash Legion \"defectors\" were double agents sent to find a way across enemy lines. But for now, all we can do is wait."
