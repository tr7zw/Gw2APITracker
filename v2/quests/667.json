Ominous signs aside, Kasmeer invited me to a little gathering at the Dead End Bar. The whole gang was there, even Taimi. She was up in arms about Scarlet, the drill, the ley lines; all of it. When I finally spoke with Kasmeer, she touched on the topic on all our mindsâ€”we were dealing with a new Elder Dragon. The sobering moment was interrupted by the arrival of a Seraph soldier: Belinda Delaqua, Marjory\u0027s sister. The two of them caught up a little after introductions, but Belinda didn\u0027t stay long; she was headed west to a new assignment near the Maguuma Wastes."
