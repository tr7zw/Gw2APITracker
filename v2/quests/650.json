Inside, Logan and Marjory were rummaging through evidence from Scarlet\u0027s attackâ€”piecing together any intel they could gather.\n\nLady Anise stopped by to hand over additional evidence to Logan, but the two were at odds again. Logan believes that Anise is leaving him out of her schemes, and that she\u0027s putting the queen\u0027s safety at risk by keeping him in the dark. They\u0027re both working toward the same goal, but can\u0027t seem to cooperate long enough to internalize it.\n\nBetween the events in the Shiverpeaks, the tragedy at Dragon Bash, and the lives lost in Divinity\u0027s Reach... Scarlet might sit at the center of it all. I can only hope we\u0027re prepared for her next strike."
