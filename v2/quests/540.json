It was then that I finally recognized her—she was present in Aurene\u0027s vision of the future! Confident in our future alliance, I invited her to help us take down Kralkatorrik. I don\u0027t know if she\u0027ll accept, but she did turn over Balthazar\u0027s sword.\n\nAll that remains is to re-ignite the sword using magic from Rytlock\u0027s sword, Sohothin. Then it\u0027s time to enter the Mists and use the sword as magical bait to attach Blish\u0027s tracker to Kralkatorrik. Easy, right?"
