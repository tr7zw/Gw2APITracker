I found them deep in an ice cavern, looking for a magical scroll for Braham to use on his mother\u0027s bow. When I caught up, they were in trouble, but with my added brains and brawn, we made it to the scroll and slayed the icebrood goliath. I learned that Braham is having more trouble with Eir\u0027s death than I\u0027d realized. He\u0027s bent on independence and on going after Jormag himself, convinced that it\u0027s his duty. I was unable to convince him to join Dragon\u0027s Watch so we could pursue a plan together. We parted on less-than-good terms, and Rox stayed to watch over him."
