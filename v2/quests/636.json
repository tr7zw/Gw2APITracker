Knut expressed his regrets, but his remorse felt forced. I think Braham\u0027s anger was justified—if anything, given the loss of his home his anger was modest."

He doesn\u0027t pass out compliments as readily as, say, Logan, but his warmth is subtle.\n\nAfter everything I witnessed at the hatchery and mine, I can tell Rox is a good one. A little weary, but she\u0027s sharp—and with the way things are escalating, we need more allies."

Standing there, I couldn\u0027t help but feel uneasy. I suspect this is the beginning of something bigger. I can\u0027t put my finger on it, but all those experiments... Well, we\u0027ll see what happens next.\n\nTonight, we celebrate. Even if all we\u0027re celebrating is a moment of rest."
