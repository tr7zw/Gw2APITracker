According to her, Kellach was obsessed with protecting Kryta, and wanted to use her scrying powers. He used them to look into Orr and something there corrupted him. When he demanded a cure, she bluffed that only \"blood of great power and significance\" would work. Enraged by this, he killed her. If he still wants that cure, there\u0027s only one thing it could beâ€”killing the queen! We need to let Logan know right away."
