      "complete": "I decided to turn the team in the direction of Rata Novus upon learning the lost asuran city may have resources we could use against Mordremoth. On our way, we crossed paths with some Pact soldiers who had been held captive with Zojja and Logan. They explained that our captured friends had sacrificed their freedom to create a distraction while the soldiers got away. Unfortunately, some of the Pact group had gone missing when a murderous creature chased them into nearby caves. Braham and I put down the beast, but could not save the soldiers. One of them lived long enough to relay in which direction the Mordrem cavalcade took Zojja and Logan. I made the call to split our team. Half of the team will track the cavalcade, while Braham, Canach, Taimi, and I head to Rata Novusâ€”hopefully toward allies or insight that will help us kill this dragon."
