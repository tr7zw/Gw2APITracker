      "complete": "I learned from Kasmeer and Efram that the Renegades have been quietly trying to recruit young charr into their ranks. On top of the other signs of violence and hate, the idea of the Renegades expanding the reach of their xenophobic extremism was disturbing. With Kasmeer\u0027s help to disguise me as Ryland—a reputable charr with the freedom to move around and ask questions—I set out to investigate. The trail led me from the fahrar through the Blood Keep, and then the urgency ramped up. I learned the Renegades had kidnapped Gorrik and were searching his datapad for useful information about Aurene. I was able to get Gorrik to safety, but I made a terrible discovery in the process: Ryland was working with the Renegades, and they were helping Bangar gather forces for a questionable mission."
