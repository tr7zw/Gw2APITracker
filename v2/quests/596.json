      "complete": "Back at the Eye of the North, Aurene continued to verbally spar with Jormag, who insisted that there was no way out of this situation without killing Primordus. The ice dragon also conveyed that they can see and hear everything their champion witnesses. We need to be even more careful what we say around Ryland.\n\nAurene shared her concern with me. Problems around Tyria were about to get much worse with two raging Elder Dragons competing for magic. With Primordus on the rise, Jormag is doing everything they can to get the upper hand. I urged Aurene to join the fight, but she declined. In her view, having a third Elder Dragon meddling with volatile magic could destabilize everything further. Instead, she vowed to assist us from the Eye. I hope it\u0027s enough."
