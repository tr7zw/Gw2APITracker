We fought through the corrupted lord of the manse\u0027s illusions, killed him and his undead servants, and disposed of the Mouth, but we lost good soldiers in the process. Without the Mouth, Zhaitan\u0027s food supply has been curtailed. I returned to Fort Trinity to check in with Marshal Trahearne and plan the Pact\u0027s next move."
