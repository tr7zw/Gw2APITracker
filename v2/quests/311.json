      "complete": "I delivered the bad news about Tonn to his widow, Ceera. As a Pact medic, she deals with death every day, but that didn\u0027t make Tonn\u0027s heroic sacrifice any easier to hear. In her grief, she blamed me for Tonn\u0027s death and ran off, straight into a throng of undead. I was able to rescue her, but she remained furious and refused to forgive me. I can only hope that our eventual victory over the dragons will make Ceera see that Tonn\u0027s bravery saved countless lives and helped secure Tyria\u0027s freedom."
