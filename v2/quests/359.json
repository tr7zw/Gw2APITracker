      "complete": "I rejoined Marjory, Kasmeer, Braham, Rox, and Taimi to search for the Master of Peace before the saboteur, Aerin, could catch him. We found Aerin and pursued him deep into the canyon. Aerin\u0027s behavior was manic, almost like Scarlet\u0027s during her final days. He fought fiercely, but ultimately lost. The Master of Peace said that Aerin wanted great power but was refused. He didn\u0027t explain what that meant, nor did he say where he was headed next. His backpack was loaded with somethingâ€”probably supplies. He may be embarking on a long journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI searched Aerin\u0027s corpse. He was carrying a note with frantic scrawlings that said a \"leader will die\" and that \"the rest will fall in line.\" Did he mean the Master of Peace or someone else? I also found some animal hairs on Aerin\u0027s corpse that probably came from livestock back in Prosperity. We should return there and continue our investigation."
