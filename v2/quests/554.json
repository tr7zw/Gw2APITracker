I heard from them over comms—sometimes deliberately, sometimes not—about how much fun they were having at the All-Legion Rally. Meanwhile I made my own tour and checked in the with the other imperators: Ash\u0027s Malice Swordshadow, Iron\u0027s Smodur the Unflinching, and Flame\u0027s Efram Greetsglory. My apologies for Aurene\u0027s disruption seemed to go over well, and I got a hint of some of the intrigues among the highest-ranking charr, but by the time I returned to Crecia, there were new problems to deal with. Braham had managed to land himself in the brig for enjoying the festivities a little too much. With Crecia\u0027s go-ahead, I went to bail him out."
