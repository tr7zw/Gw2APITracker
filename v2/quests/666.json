Chaos provided the perfect cover for Scarlet\u0027s forces to move in for the kill. We rushed into the city to give aid as best we could, but the enemy had overwhelmed and routed the Lionguard amid a growing miasma of toxic gas. We did our best to push back against our foes and evacuate the citizens, but the loss of life was severe. I\u0027ve never seen such ruin in Lion\u0027s Arch; not since Zhaitan\u0027s assault on Claw Island. I took a moment between escort groups to peer over to the harbor, where a massive drill had lowered from Scarlet\u0027s flying fortress, pushing deep into the bedrock below."
