The minion grew so strong that it broke free and had to be put down, but we got our proof. We agreed to consult Zojja and the other order reps before we decide on our next course of action."

Zojja explained that whichever order\u0027s plan I chose would be the order I joined permanently as part of her long-range goal of building strong alliances against the Elder Dragons. I made my choice, and we set out to show the world that Gorr is right: dragons eat magic."
