      "complete": "We entered the lost, underground asura city with the promise of possibly finding allies in the war against Mordremoth, but those hopes were quickly dashed when we confirmed Tizlak\u0027s informationâ€”the city was long dead. However, there was a chance their research still existed, so we powered up the city and followed the biggest energy draw to their Elder Dragon lab. The only way inside involved Taimi sacrificing Scruffy to bridge a blown-out ley circuit. She proved to us she\u0027s more than just an asura with a golem, she\u0027s a self-sufficient soldier. Once in the Rata Novus Elder Dragon lab we discovered that each dragon has a unique and respective weakness. We didn\u0027t discover what Mordremoth\u0027s was, but at least we know the dragon can be felled. Our job now is to find out how."
