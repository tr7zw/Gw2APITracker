Kasmeer had fully overcome her hesitation about fighting Balthazar, his actions having negated any lingering reverence she may have held for himâ€”and not a moment too soon. Balthazar appeared atop a massive mechanical monstrosity he called the Warbeast: a terrifying hybrid of living creature and armored siege engine. This is what Balthazar and the Forged were building in Glint\u0027s Lair: a piece of ordnance that could contain and transport Aurene, then use her as a weapon to kill Kralkatorrik. With Aurene helpless inside his Warbeast, Balthazar marched his creation forward to confront Kralkatorrik. \nFortunately, Rytlock put our shared mission first and loaned me his sword Sohothin, predicting that it would give me a decisive edge that Balthazar would not be expecting."

      "complete": "Rytlock was right, but even with Sohothin, it took all my riding and combat skills to catch and disable the Warbeast. As it was, I didn\u0027t get to it in time before it directly engaged Kralkatorrik, and it actually did serious damage to the Elder Dragon before I was able to destroy it. \nBut Balthazar refused to give up. If he was thrown off by my coming back to life, or Sohothin, or my victory over his Warbeast, he remained true to form and didn\u0027t let that distract him from his objective. He took Aurene and declared he would use her to finish what the Warbeast started: killing the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik."
