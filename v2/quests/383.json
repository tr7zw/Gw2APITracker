He\u0027d been separated from Caithe during their mission and was hiding in the shadows to avoid being spotted by Mordrem. We made our way through the valley and rejoined Caithe, who was locked in battle with the dragonspawn.\n\nWe learned where the Mordrem were nesting and observed their movements. While I hesitate to call them \"intelligent\" creatures, they do exhibit simple tactical behavior in combat. This information should help us in the war ahead.\n\nWe signaled for extraction and fought tirelessly against the relentless tide of enemies. Fortunately, the Pact sent a chopper that carried us back to safety."
