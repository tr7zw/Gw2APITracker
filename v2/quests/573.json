Malice Swordshadow took the lead, and together we infiltrated the base in secret. That is, until Smodur got tired of tiptoeing around and tripped the alarm.\n\nRyland wasn\u0027t even there. Luckily, Cinder Steeltemper was. Smodur was ready to kill Ryland\u0027s second-in-command to send a message, but Crecia argued for using her as a bargaining chip. Once again, Crecia\u0027s compromise won out, and Cinder was spared, much to Smodur\u0027s angry protests."
