They got on well, bonding over the shared experience of combating Scarlet\u0027s various schemes to date.\n\nStanding among all of my new comrades, I can\u0027t help but feel like we\u0027re at the catalyst. I don\u0027t know what Scarlet is going to pull next, but I feel we\u0027re nearing the peak of this mountain."
