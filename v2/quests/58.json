      "complete": "I formally joined the Vigil to take down Rakt of the Arcane Eye. Crusader Slep joined me in the attack, and after a fierce battle, we were able to take Rakt down. This allowed for Professor Gorr\u0027s theory to be freely distributed, but Councillor Flax admitted that the Arcane Council had known Gorr\u0027s theory was true all along and was stifling the information until they figured out a way to exploit it. Zojja told me she was heading for Lion\u0027s Arch to meet up with an old friend, and since my new Vigil mentor is also waiting in Lion\u0027s Arch, I told her I\u0027d look for her there."
