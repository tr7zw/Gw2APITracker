      "complete": "I regrouped with Marjory and Kasmeer inside of the tower\u0027s innermost chamber a few weeks later. Even though we were able to clear the way to the heart, giving us ample opportunity to inject the antitoxin, the Tower of Nightmares continued to corrupt Kessex Hills with toxic spores. No matter how many doses they injected into the heart, the tower stood tall. Marjory knew we were missing something, but what was it?\n\nWe took a small portion of the leftover antitoxin and used it to break our way into a hidden lab near the injector. Inside, we found several Molten, Inquest, and Toxic Alliance devices presumably being used to maintain the integrity of Scarlet\u0027s wild contraption. We were able to extract various materials from the devices, and when combined in Scarlet\u0027s personal forge, they created a magical, antibarrier compound. We injected the new mixture—along with the remaining antitoxin—into the heart of the tower. The new compound shattered the heart\u0027s defenses and allowed the antitoxin to take its toll. The tower began to collapse and Kasmeer started conjuring us a portal to escape, but we were ambushed by a small squad of lingering Nightmare Court. Thankfully, Kasmeer was able to finish the portal in the nick of time and we watched the whole thing crumble to the ground from the shore of the lake.\n\nWe made a real blow to Scarlet\u0027s plans today, but knowing her... Well, all we may have accomplished is making her that much angrier."
