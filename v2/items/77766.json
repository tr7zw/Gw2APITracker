  "description": "\u003cc\u003d@flavor\u003eOgden Stonehealer reached out the Eldvin Monastery to re-create a beer that was an old dwarven favorite. This dark stout contains complex flavors of molasses, roasted coffee, and drops of licorice without being bitter or overly sweet. Surprisingly, the flavor strongly evolves with the temperature of the brew.\u003c/c\u003e",
